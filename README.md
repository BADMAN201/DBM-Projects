# Server Storing

This is version 0.2 of my new Server Storing feature, and it lets you or your users load/save roles, channels, etc.

## How to install
Open both files in github & click on the "raw" button, then copy everything on that raw page and put it as **commands** in DBM.

## Versions

### 0.2
- Roles:
  - Updated the saving, instead of counting its random to prioritize it not being stolen by others
- Channel saving & loading was added

### 0.1
- First Release;
   - Save role
   - Load role

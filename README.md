# Release
This report system will allow all users to report someone (other than themselves) once every 5 minutes (customizable).
Both report points expires after 10 minutes. A user can not be reported more than 2 times every 10 minutes.

The system will not work if;
- The channel hasnt been set
- The user is reporting himself
- A valid link wasnt provided.
- The command was not used properly.

Correct format:
[p]report @User (https://link.here) (reason 2+ words)

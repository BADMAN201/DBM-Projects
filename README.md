# Token Feature

This is a token feature which allows you to have premium commands for servers.

### How to use/install
1. Get all the inside json code and put it all as commands except **Premium Format.json**
2. Copy the insides of "premium format" and place it before any command you want to be premium.
3. Done!

### How it works
It works using tokens. Only you (set your id in the commands) can create tokens. Everytime a token is redeemed, it'll be deleted, and a new file with the information about the server will be made.

### Features
